# Small console project using Inquirer y CLI-Table3 for js

This is a small project that I created with the goal of understanding the [`cli-table3`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli-table3) and [`inquirer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) libraries for JavaScript using Node.js.

## ðŸ“¦ Technologies used

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
- [cli-table3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli-table3)

## ðŸš€ How to install

1. The user must clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JuanDLovisa/prueba-control-stock.git
   cd folder-name

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install

3. Run init-db.js just once:
    ```bash
    node init-db.js
This file will create a database called control_stock, enter your user (default root) and password to connect with mysql.

4. Start the program and give it a try:
    ```bash
    node index.mjs
